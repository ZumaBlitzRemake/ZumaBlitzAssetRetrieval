# Zuma Blitz Asset Retrieval

> <span style="font-size:16pt">ðŸš¨</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/shambles_sm/status/1624588915461222400" style="font-size:16pt">MAJORITY OF THE GAME ASSETS HAVE BEEN FOUND - CLICK HERE FOR MORE INFO!</a></b>

A repository to keep track of Zuma Blitz asset retrieval efforts. Currently,
these assets are fetched from various sources, from blogs to artist portfolios.

While raw assets are the most desirable, screenshots from portfolios are acceptable.

For more details on our leads, please check [TIMELINE.md](TIMELINE.md).

## Contributing

If you find any media that you think is acceptable for this repository, please open
an issue.

However, it's better if the **game assets themselves** are found. However, this is no
easy feat.

**If you have a machine (or at the very least, a HDD) that has ran Zuma Blitz before,
extract it's cache immediately.** Read Flashpoint's guide on retrieving cache files:
<https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/datahub/Recovering_Files_from_Browser_Cache#Flashpoint_Cache_Exporter>

**We also do not have any raw maps, so if you think you may have such assets, please
contact me immediately.**

Then, open an issue or better yet, contact me on Discord: `Shambles#3117`
